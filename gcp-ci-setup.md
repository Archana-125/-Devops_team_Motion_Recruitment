Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting Up a Basic CI Pipeline on GCP
This document outlines the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Google Cloud Build on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Step 1: Create a New Branch Named “feature-gcp-ci”
Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to the directory of your project repository.
Create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature-gcp-ci
Step 2: Add a File Named “gcp-ci-setup.md”
Create a new file named “gcp-ci-setup.md” in your project directory.
Open the file and document the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Google Cloud Build on GCP.
Step 3: Define Pipeline Stages
Build Stage
GitLab CI

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Configure the runner:
Install GitLab Runner.
Register the runner with your project.
Define build steps:
Install necessary dependencies.
Compile or build the application.
Google Cloud Build

Create a cloudbuild.yaml file in your repository.
Define build steps:
Define steps to install dependencies.
Configure steps to build/compile the application.
Enable Cloud Build API in GCP.
Link your repository to Cloud Build.
Test Stage
GitLab CI

Add test execution steps to .gitlab-ci.yml.
Install required testing frameworks.
Run tests and collect results:
Integrate test reports within GitLab CI.
Google Cloud Build

Add test steps to cloudbuild.yaml.
Install required testing frameworks.
Execute tests and collect results:
Use Cloud Build logs and notifications for reporting.
Deploy Stage
GitLab CI

Add a deployment step to the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Set up Google Cloud SDK and authenticate within GitLab CI.
Deploy application to an instance on GCP:
Use appropriate commands to transfer files and start the application.
Google Cloud Build

Add deploy stage to cloudbuild.yaml.
Set up proper authentication and permissions for Cloud Build to deploy to GCP.
Deploy the application:
Define steps to transfer files and run deployment commands on a GCP Compute Engine instance.
Step 4: Configure Build Triggers
GitLab CI

Set up webhooks or use built-in GitLab CI triggers to automatically start the pipeline on code changes.
Optionally, configure pipeline schedules.
Google Cloud Build

Configure build triggers in the Cloud Build console.
Set triggers to run on code pushes or pull requests.
Optionally, schedule build triggers.
Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Stage your changes:
git add gcp-ci-setup.md
Commit with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Add gcp-ci-setup.md for setting up CI pipeline on GCP"
Step 6: Push Your Changes and Create Pull Request
Push the “feature-gcp-ci” branch to the remote repository:
git push origin feature-gcp-ci
Navigate to your repository platform (GitLab or Google Cloud Source Repositories).
Create a pull request to merge “feature-gcp-ci” into the main branch.
Final Notes:

Ensure that the documentation is clear and detailed, providing prerequisites and assumptions.
Optimize each stage for efficiency and performance, suitable for competitive programming scenarios.
Regularly update the documentation based on feedback and changes in the CI/CD processes.
By following these steps, you will successfully set up a basic CI pipeline on GCP using GitLab CI or Google Cloud Build.
