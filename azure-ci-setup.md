Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting Up a Basic CI Pipeline on Azure
This document outlines the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure.

Step 1: Create a New Branch Named “feature-azure-ci”
Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to the directory of your project repository.
Create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature-azure-ci
Step 2: Add a File Named “azure-ci-setup.md”
Create a new file named “azure-ci-setup.md” in your project directory.
Open the file and start documenting the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure.
Step 3: Define Pipeline Stages
Build Stage
GitLab CI

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Configure the runner:
Install GitLab Runner.
Register the runner with your project.
Define build steps:
Install necessary dependencies.
Compile or build the application.
Azure DevOps

Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps.
Set up the azure-pipelines.yml file.
Configure build agent:
Select an appropriate agent pool.
Install necessary build tasks.
Define build steps in azure-pipelines.yml:
Install dependencies.
Build the application.
Test Stage
GitLab CI

Add test execution steps to the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Install required testing frameworks.
Run tests and collect results:
Integrate test reports within GitLab CI.
Azure DevOps

Add testing tasks to the azure-pipelines.yml file.
Install required testing frameworks.
Run tests and analyze results:
Use built-in test reporting features.
Deploy Stage
GitLab CI

Add a deployment step to the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Configure SSH keys for secure connection to the Azure VM.
Execute deployment script to transfer files and start the application on Azure VM.
Azure DevOps

Create a release pipeline.
Configure deployment stages and jobs in the Azure DevOps interface.
Set up service connections for secure deployment to the Azure VM.
Step 4: Configure Build Triggers
GitLab CI

Set up webhooks or use built-in GitLab CI triggers to start the pipeline on code changes.
Optionally, configure pipeline schedules.
Azure DevOps

Configure continuous integration triggers in the pipeline settings.
Set up branch policies to ensure builds are triggered on code changes and pull requests.
Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Stage your changes:
git add azure-ci-setup.md
Commit with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Add azure-ci-setup.md for setting up CI pipeline on Azure"
Step 6: Push Your Changes and Create Pull Request
Push the “feature-azure-ci” branch to the remote repository:
git push origin feature-azure-ci
Navigate to your repository platform (GitLab or Azure Repos).
Create a pull request to merge “feature-azure-ci” into the main branch.
Final Notes:

Ensure that the documentation is clear and detailed, providing prerequisites and assumptions.
Optimize each stage for efficiency and performance, suitable for competitive programming scenarios.
Regularly update the documentation based on feedback and changes in the CI/CD processes.
By following these steps, you will successfully set up a basic CI pipeline on Azure using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps.
